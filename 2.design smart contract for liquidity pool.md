In this section, let's see how we can design the smart contract for liquiditty pool. The smart contract will responsible for creating a pair of tokens, and make sure the product of token number of the pair remain as a constant. First we will 
design an interface for the liquidity poll smart contract, since the logic of the code is a little bit complex, we will grow the code of the contract step by step, first we give a set of functions in the interface which is need to be 
implemented by each liquidity pool contract, create a file name ITokenPair.sol in backend/contract/interface, and add the following code:

```sol
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

interface ITokenPair {
    /*
    this method return the address of smart contract
    that implement the interface
    */
    function factory() external view returns (address);

    /*
    This method return the address of stmart contract
    used to manage tokenA in the pair
    */
    function tokenA() external view returns (address);

    /*
    This method return the address of stmart contract
    used to manage tokenA in the pair
    */
    function tokenB() external view returns (address);

    /*
    This method return the constant product of number of 
    tokenA and tokenB
    */
    function KLast() external view returns(uint256);
}
```

Then we create a file named TokenPair.sol in the contract directory, it will implement methods of above interface, the code is as following:

```sol

```
