In this section, let's see how we can design the smart contract for liquiditty pool. The smart contract will responsible for creating a pair of tokens, and make sure the product of token number of the pair remain as a constant. First we will 
design an interface for the liquidity poll smart contract, since the logic of the code is a little bit complex, we will grow the code of the contract step by step, first we give a set of functions in the interface which is need to be 
implemented by each liquidity pool contract, create a file name ITokenPair.sol in backend/contract/interface, and add the following code:

```sol
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

interface ITokenPair {
    /*
    this method return the address of smart contract
    that implement the interface
    */
    function factory() external view returns (address);

    /*
    This method return the address of stmart contract
    used to manage tokenA in the pair
    */
    function tokenA() external view returns (address);

    /*
    This method return the address of stmart contract
    used to manage tokenA in the pair
    */
    function tokenB() external view returns (address);

    /*
    This method return the constant product of number of 
    tokenA and tokenB
    */
    function KLast() external view returns(uint256);
}
```

Then we create a file named TokenPair.sol in the contract directory, it will implement methods of above interface, the code is as following:

```sol
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "./interfaces/ITokenPair.sol";

contract TokenPair is ITokenPair, ERC20, ReentrancyGuard {
    address public factory;
    address public tokenA;
    address public tokenB;
    uint256 public KLast;
}
```
The above code indicates the TokenPair smart contract need to implement interfaces from ITokenPair and ERC20, as we have seen before, ERC20 is used for token generation and management. Let's see how we can implement interface of ITokenPari
for the smart contract above:

```sol
contract TokenPair is ITokenPair, ERC20 {
    ....
    constructor() ERC20("DEX Token Pair", "DEX-TP") {
        factory = msg.sender;
    }

    function initialize(address _tokenA, address _tokenB) external {
        require(msg.sender == factory, "NOT_FACTORY");
        tokenA = _tokenA;
        tokenB = _tokenB;
    }
}
```
In the code above, we can see the initialize function need to be called by anoter contract which will send the contract address for handling tokenA and tokenB in the pool. Let's provide a method to get the reserver of tokenA and tokenB:

```sol
uint256 private reserverA;
    uint256 private reserverB;
    uint256 private blockTimestampLast;
    function getReserves() public view returns(
        uint256 _reserveA,
        uint256 _reserveB,
        uint256 _blockTimestampLast
    ) {
        _reserveA = reserverA;
        _reserveB = reserverB;
        _blockTimestampLast = blockTimestampLast;
    }

function _setReserves(uint256 balanceA, uint256 balanceB) private {
        reserverA = balanceA;
        reserverB = balanceB;
        blockTimestampLast = block.timestamp;
    }
```
In above code, we need to keep the reserve number as private and record the time of reserve changing since hackers are incentived to manipulate the reserve number for impacting the trading price. When user trading the tokens in the pool,
they will swap one kind of token for the other, and we need to support the token swapping in the smart contract. Since token trading involves financial, we need to handle it very carefully and we can't call transfer from ERC20 since we need
to revert the transaction if any errors happen in the process.

We will use the low level data call we have seen in previous section. That is we call the transfer method from the token contract with its binary signature, as we have seen in previous section, the low level call will return a bool indicator
to show whether the call is success or not, the code is like following:

```sol
//convert the function signature into binary data
    bytes4 private constant SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(
        bytes("transfer(address, uint256)")
    ));

    function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 value) private {
        /*
        create call data, if the binary data contains a method signture of the contract being call,
        the given contract will call the method and return the calling result
        */
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(SELECTOR,
        to, value));
        //if the call fail, the require will force the transaction to revert
        require(success && (data.length == 0 || 
        abi.decode(data, (bool))), "TRANSFER_FAILED");
    }
```

One thing need to be noticed is that, when contracts located at different address or deployed sperately , and they want to coorperate with each other, using low level call is the norm. This is just like different micro services send messages
to each other, or using RPC or restful API to coorperate together. Now it's time to implement the management of LP token, as we have told before, LP tokens just like dollars for stock exchange, we can use LP tokens to take out some amount
of token pair from the pool and can inject token pair into the pool for getting LP tokens back.

We need to satisfy the following steps for generating LP tokens:
1, compute the number of LP tokens need to be minted.

2,Generate the given amount of LP tokens and transfer them to traders who injecting given number of token pair into the pool.

3,update the number for tokenA and tokenB in the pool.

We need to decide how many LP tokens we need to generate for the given pool, if the product of tokenA with tokenB is K, then the number of LP tokens for the pool is math.sqrt(K).

The code for generating LP token is as following:

```sol
uint256 public constant MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 10**3;
    function mint(address to) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 liquidity) {
       

      (uint256 _reserveA, uint256 _reserveB, ) = getReserves();

      /*
      There are two cases for generating LP tokens, the first case is when
      the pool come into being, then the number of LP token 
      is sqrt(number of tokenA * number of tokenB), at this time
      the _reserveA and _reserveB are 0
      */
      //amount of newly tokens injecting to the pool
      uint256 balanceA = IERC20(tokenA).balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceB = IERC20(tokenB).balanceOf(address(this));

      //amount of tokens injecting to the pool
      uint256 amountA = balanceA - _reserveA;
      uint256 amountB = balanceB - _reserveB; 

      //LP tokens currently for the pool
      uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
      if (_totalSupply == 0) {
          /*
          we need to destroy a little amount of LP tokens to prevent 
          someone collect all LP tokens and swap all the tokenA and 
          tokenB from the pool and empty the pool
          */
          liquidity = Math.sqrt(amountA * amountB) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
          _mint(address(0xDEAD), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
      } else {
        /*
        the second case is, when some one inject certain amount of tokenA
        and tokenB into the pool and the exchange need to issue some amount
        of LP tokens as certificate

        for S = sqrt(_reserveA * _reserveB) which is the value return
        by calling totalSupply()

        When injecting tokens into the pool, the number(r_A) of tokenA and
        number(r_B) of tokenB should satisfy the ratio which is 
        r_A / r_B = _reserveA / _reserveB, and the amount of LP token to issused
        is sqrt(r_A * r_B) = r_A * sqrt(_reserveB / _reserveA) = (r_A * S) / _reserveA
        we cant also get sqrt(r_A * r_B) = (r_B * S) / _reserveB

        but the result of (r_A * S) / _reserveA may a little be different dure to
        floating computation, and we take the smaller one as the final result.
        */
         liquidity = Math.min(
            (amountA * _totalSupply) / _reserveA,
            (amountB * _totalSupply) / _reserveB
         );

         require(liquidity > 0, "INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY_MINTED");
         /*
         generate the given number of LP token send it to receiver,
         */
        _mint(to, liquidity);
        //update the reserve
        _setReserves(balanceA, balanceB);

     
        
      }
    }

```
We can refer to above code for how to compute the increasing amount of LP tokens.  Now we need to compute the return for DEX owner, for each trading, the DEX will reserve some amount of input tokens for trading fee. For example if user
input 1000 tokenA to swap given amount of tokenB, the DEX will take out 0.2% of input tokenA that is 1000 * 0.2% = 2 tokenA and save these 2 tokenA in the pool and using 998 tokenA for swaping. Since each trading will cause some amount of
token inject into the pool, therefore as trading going on, the total number of tokens in the pool will increase.

Then we need to create some new LP tokens to represent the newly increase tokens in the pool. The increase amount of LP token will compute as following:

1, reserveA, reserveB is the amount for given time point.

2, reserve'A, reserve'B is the amount after a certain period of trading.

3. Since DEX always take out a small portion of input token to inject into the pool, therefore reserve'A * reserve'B >= reserveA * reserveB

4. if the return rate for DEX is R = 0.1 then we need to create following amount of LP tokens for DEX owner:
K = Math.sqrt(reserve'A * reserve'B ) - Math.sqrt(reserveA * reserveB), S is the current amount of all LP token, then we need to mint following amount of LP token as return for DEX owner:

S' = (S * R * K) / (Math.sqrt(reserveA * reserveB) + (1-R) * K)

The code is as following:

```sol
/*
    DEX owner will change some fee for each transaction, 
    for example if user putting 1000 piece tokenA to swap tokenB,
    then DEX owner will charge 0.2% of the 1000 that is 2 tokenA will reserve
    in the pool and 998 tokenA will used for swapping, with trading going one
    the reserve in the pool will increase.

    The increase amount of the reserve will shared by token provider and DEX owner,
    if before the increase of the pool ,the reserve of 
    tokenA and tokenB is r_A, r_B, and after the increase, the reserve is
    r'_A, r'_B, S is the number of LP token and R=0.1 is the fee rate for DEX owner
    , then we need to generate new amount of S' LP token for DEX owner by:
    k = (sqrt(r'_A * r'_B)  - sqrt(r_A * r_B))
    S' = [S * R * k] / [ R*sqrt(r_A * r_B) + (1 - R) * (k)]
    */

    function _mintReward(uint256 _resverveA, uint256 _reserveB) private returns(bool hasReward) {
        //will add it later
        address rewardTo = IPairFactory(factory).rewardTo();
        hasReward = rewardTo != address(0);
        //reserve before increase
        uint256 _kLast = KLast;
        if (hasReward) {
            uint256 rootK = Math.sqrt(_resverveA * _reserveB);
            uint256 rootKLast = Math.sqrt(_kLast); 
            if (rootK > rootKLast) {
                uint256 K = rootK - rootKLast;
                uint256 S = totalSupply();
                uint256 R = 0.1;
                uint256 liquidity = (S * R * K) / (R * rootKLast + (1 - R) * K);
                if (liquidity > 0) {
                    _mint(rewardTo, liquidity);
                }
            }
        }
        else if (_kLast != 0) {
            //not owner, 
            KLast = 0;
        }
    }
```

Then we need to call above function when we call the mint function to generate LP tokens, the change for mint function is as following:

```sol
function mint(address to) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 liquidity) {
    ....
    //amount of newly tokens injecting to the pool
      uint256 amountA = balanceA - _reserveA;
      uint256 amountB = balanceB - _reserveB; 
      //compute reward for DEX
      bool hasReward = _mintReward(_reserveA, _reserveB);
   ....
     if (_totalSupply == 0) {
          /*
          we need to destroy a little amount of LP tokens to prevent 
          someone collect all LP tokens and swap all the tokenA and 
          tokenB from the pool and empty the pool
          */
          liquidity = Math.sqrt(amountA * amountB) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
          _mint(address(0xDEAD), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
      } else {
      ....
        if (hasReward) {
            KLast = reserverA * reserverB;
        }
      }
}
```
